= Hop Run

Hop Run is a command line tool to run your workflows and pipelines.

Hop Run can be launched through the script with the corresponding name in your Hop installation directory, either `hop-run.sh` on Mac and Linux or `hop-run.bat` on Windows.

Except for the laucher script, all options are platform agnostic; there is no difference in the way hop-run works on any operating system.


== Hop Run Options

You can display Hop Run's options by running the command without any options.

If you're on Windows (tough luck), run `hop-run.bat`, on Mac and Linux, run `hop-run.sh`.

You'll see the option listed in a similar output to the one below:
